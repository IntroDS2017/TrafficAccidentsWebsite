  <h1 id="title">Traffic accidents in Helsinki city area</h1>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p class="text-field">
    We have done research based on the open datasets on ‘Road traffic accidents’ and ‘Traffic Volumes’ in the Helsinki city area.
    Our initial plan was to find correlations between the traffic volumes and the road accidents on different streets in Helsinki, and we also wanted to see if there are any especially dangerous roads out there.
    <br>
    Following when we talk about annual ’traffic volume’ on a certain road, we mean the amount motor vehicles that annually pass that certain measurement point.

    <br><br>

    The dataset ‘Traffic Volumes’ in Helsinki provides information on the volumes of different vehicles on the streets of Helsinki from the year 2011 onwards. The traffic volumes were counted hourly (Monday-Thursday) in September and October, so the data represents average daily volumes during these two months.
    <br>
    The other dataset ‘Road traffic accidents’ contains records of all traffic accidents in Finland (except in Åland) from 2005 to 2016. We used the data from 2011 to 2016, and selected the entries that are in the Helsinki area.
  </p>


  <h3>Results</h3>

  <p>The following are some figures we have produced based on data.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The first figure expresses the amount of traffic in certain streets in Helsinki annually.</li>
      <li>The second figure expresses the amounts of different kinds of traffic accidents for the same streets.</li>
      <li>The third figure displays the ratio between these two.</li>

      <br>For the third figure, high ratio means that the amount of accidents per traffic amount is high.
      <br>If we had more information, we might even say that the likelihood of an accident happening on that street is higher than typically.

      On the x-axis, you can see the different roads in alphabetical order, and for each road, six bars representing
      the years from 2011 to 2016. On the y-axis we have approximated annual traffic volume formed by multiplying the average
      daily volume from September to October by 365. Unit: 3.0 * 1e7 = 30 000 000 cars.

    <span class="figure-text col-xs-12"><b>Figure 3. Annual accidents vs. traffic comparison.</b>
      On the y-axis you can see the ratio between the accidents and traffic volumes. The higher the ratio, the more accidents
      have occured on average for traffic volume. The ratio itself doesn't tell about the number of individuals involved in the accident.
